## Installing Vue

```
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

Find your vue cli tool in your user profile path
```
C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\npm

```

## Starting a Vue project

Make sure you have the vue cli installed and you can call the cli to start a project using the following:

```
vue create name-of-app
```

At the labs, you will have to reference the entire user path to get to your appdata folder to access vue.cmd after installing the cli:

```
C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\npm\vue.cmd create name-of-app
